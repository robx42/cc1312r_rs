Peripheral Access Crate for the TI CC1312R microprocessor 

This is a first attempt at creating a peripheral access crate.  From TI's e2e community, it appears that TI doesn't provide SVD files or support rust.  I'm using this project to learn more about migrating from c to Rust for embedded development.  Hopefully it will turn into something useful for others as well.
